HW 2 part 1 and 2 worked with Davey Ives, Imran Khan and based work on Matt Sauter who worked with Davey. Part 3 worked with Srikanth, Imran and Valeria

Part 1
This was python script to use an API to pull from the MTA site and display it in the bash terminal. The run the python script the API from the MTA requires an access key personal to my user request as well as the bus line code. For example M11. Once the key and bus line is received what is displayed is the longitude and latitude and location. 

Part 2
Simlar to part 1, this was python script to use an API to pull from the MTA site and display it in the bash terminal. The run the python script the API from the MTA requires an access key personal to my user request as well as the bus line code and a file name to write a csv file to be stored in the file location.

Part 3
This was a code to pull data as a data frame and manipulate the columns and plot the numeric data. The data was pulled from the from http://urbanprofiler.cloudapp.net/ while the CDF was down based on Matt and Davey's recomendation. We were asked to remove non-numerics columns and dsiplay/render only the first few rows. After that the truncated data frame was plot as a scatter plot figure.
