part 1 worked with Matt, Valeria and Davey. Got a few suggestions from Rebecca and Emily to use the Wald distribution for the the 5th distribution. The goal of the assignment was to make 5 different distributions display the value of the centrality theorem. The mean was always 100 and we forced that relationship and had a random number of samples to see how many random samples does it take to have a mean of 100 as the population. The short answer based on the histogram of a the 5 distributions is about 200 samples.

part 2 I followed mjs639, Matt's work. The goal was to take citibike data and look for interesting things to render and plot to show ability to make sense of rider data.

part 3, followed along with Matt and completed basically lab 3 and related the results of the z test score to test the null hypothesis. The falsifiability of the data being a statistical outlier from a significant mean.
