# PUI2017_tma353
Spent time setting up github and my computer terminal functionality
A text file was created in terminal and updated through push and pull requests, including breaking the connection by having a conflict.
This was based on using bash to link the githup repository and PUI folder added to my PC
Also, created an alias to change the directory to my computer's folder simply, was done my updating my bash profile, image is included. Updating terminal bash profile, I cereated an alias called pui2017 that cd to /Users/tarekarafat/PUI2017, screenshot and test incldued. It used echo $PUI2017 to map the path.
I want to thank Matt Sauter and Srikanth for helping, also Valeria and Davey for forking.
