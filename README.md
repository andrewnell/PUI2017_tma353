# PUI2017_tma353
Spent time setting up github and my computer terminal functionality
A text file was created in terminal and updated through push and pull requests, including breaking the connection by having a conflict. ![alt text](https://github.com/tma353/PUI2017_tma353/blob/master/myfirstfile.png)

This was based on using bash to link the githup repository and PUI folder added to my PC
